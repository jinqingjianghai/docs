### 1. Log in to the platform

Visit [genbo AI Website](https://genbo.ai/) and click the **“Login”** button in the top right corner. Follow the prompts to fill in your basic information for login. (Note: Currently, the platform supports login via username and password, as well as OAuth login via GitHub and Google.)


### 2. Browse the model list and model details


Visit the [Models](https://genbo.ai/models) page to view the details of currently available models, including model prices and the highest speed limit available to users. You can also access the model experience center from the model details page by clicking “Online Experience”.


### 3. Obtain your **API Key** and **Base URL**


Enter [API Tokens](https://genbo.ai/apiTokens) and create a token.
Base URL = https://api.genbo.ai


### 4. Start making API calls

We are **fully aligned with OpenAI's official OpenAI Docs and API Reference**, and our usage method is **100% compatible**.
Thanks to **Model Endpoint Compatibility**, simply replace `api.openai.com` with your platform's `Base_URL` wherever OpenAI's API is used.

#### Example Replacement:
- **Official:** `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- **Ours:** `https://{{Base_URL}}/v1/chat/completions`

#### Note:
In some apps or websites, the API base may be:
- `https://api.openai.com` or
- `https://api.openai.com/v1`

In this case, replace it with:
- `https://{{Base_URL}}` or
- `https://{{Base_URL}}/v1`

#### Important for Developers:
When calling APIs in code, include your API key in the `Authorization` header like so:

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx
