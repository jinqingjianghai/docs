### 1. Log in to the platform
### 2. Browse the model list and model details
### 3. Obtain your **API Key** and **Base URL**
### 4. Start making API calls

We are **fully aligned with OpenAI's official OpenAI Docs and API Reference**, and our usage method is **100% compatible**.
Thanks to **Model Endpoint Compatibility**, simply replace `api.openai.com` with your platform's `Base_URL` wherever OpenAI's API is used.

#### Example Replacement:
- **Official:** `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- **Ours:** `https://{{Base_URL}}/v1/chat/completions`

#### Note:
In some apps or websites, the API base may be:
- `https://api.openai.com` or
- `https://api.openai.com/v1`

In this case, replace it with:
- `https://{{Base_URL}}` or
- `https://{{Base_URL}}/v1`

#### Important for Developers:
When calling APIs in code, include your API key in the `Authorization` header like so:

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk-xxxxxxxxxxxx
